            <li> <h4> Layout</h4>
                The template is designed with a responsive layout optimized for three different devices:
                <ol>
                    <li>Desktop: The layout expands up to a maximum width of 90em (equivalent to 1440px, assuming a default font size of 16px). The main content is contained within a 990px frame, providing a clean and readable white background.</li>
                    <li>Tablet: The layout adjusts to a maximum width of 100% when the screen size of the device is less than or equal to 48em, ensuring optimal display and usability on tablets.</li>
                    <li>Mobile Phones: The layout adapts to a maximum width of 100% for screen sizes smaller than or equal to 30em, ensuring a seamless and user-friendly experience on mobile phones.</li>
                </ol>
                These responsive design choices are implemented using media queries to ensure the template's adaptability and readability across different devices.

                <h4>Category Carousel on the Home Page</h4>
                <div>
                    The category carousel on the home page is implemented using a sample slider obtained from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_js_slideshow_auto">w3schools</a>. The original slider was customized to match the site's layout by adjusting the styles and timing of the JavaScript code.
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Persistent Footer Placement</h4>
                <div>
                    To ensure that the footer remains at the bottom of the page regardless of the content height, several steps were taken:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The main `<div>` element, which serves as the parent of the footer, was set to a height of 100vh (viewport height). This ensures that the main content area occupies the available vertical space on the page.</li>
                        <li>The footer was styled with `position: absolute` and `bottom: 0`, allowing it to be positioned at the bottom of the viewport.</li>
                        <li>To prevent the footer from overlapping the content on other pages, additional modifications were made. Footer-placeholder elements were added to reserve space equal to the height of the footer, ensuring that the content remains visible and unobstructed.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h2></h2>
