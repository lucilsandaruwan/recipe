        <ul>
            <li> <h4> Layout</h4>
                The template is designed with a responsive layout optimized for three different devices:
                <ol>
                    <li>Desktop: The layout expands up to a maximum width of 90em (equivalent to 1440px, assuming a default font size of 16px). The main content is contained within a 990px frame, providing a clean and readable white background.</li>
                    <li>Tablet: The layout adjusts to a maximum width of 100% when the screen size of the device is less than or equal to 48em, ensuring optimal display and usability on tablets.</li>
                    <li>Mobile Phones: The layout adapts to a maximum width of 100% for screen sizes smaller than or equal to 30em, ensuring a seamless and user-friendly experience on mobile phones.</li>
                </ol>
                These responsive design choices are implemented using media queries to ensure the template's adaptability and readability across different devices.

                <h4>Category Carousel on the Home Page</h4>
                <div>
                    The category carousel on the home page is implemented using a sample slider obtained from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_js_slideshow_auto">w3schools</a>. The original slider was customized to match the site's layout by adjusting the styles and timing of the JavaScript code.

            <li>
                <h4>Persistent Footer Placement</h4>
                <div>
                    To ensure that the footer remains at the bottom of the page regardless of the content height, several steps were taken:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The main div element, which serves as the parent of the footer, was set to a height of 100vh (viewport height). This ensures that the main content area occupies the available vertical space on the page.</li>
                        <li>The footer was styled with `position: absolute` and `bottom: 0`, allowing it to be positioned at the bottom of the viewport.</li>
                        <li>To prevent the footer from overlapping the content on other pages, additional modifications were made. Footer-placeholder elements were added to reserve space equal to the height of the footer, ensuring that the content remains visible and unobstructed.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Add ingredients and method steps in recipe create form</h4>
                <div>
                    Created an algorithm in js to append form fields when user click on add and delete ingredients and method steps of recipe create form
                </div>
            </li>

                            Flask: I chose this framework to build the application because of its versatility, simplicity, and extensive community support. 
                            Flask is a lightweight and flexible web framework that allows for easy development and customization. It provides a solid foundation for building web applications, handling routing, request handling, and response rendering. 
                            With Flask, I was able to create a robust and scalable application that meets the requirements of this project.

                        <li>
                            Sqlite: I decided to use Sqlite as the database for this project because it is a database system that I learned and became familiar with during my time at university. Since I already had knowledge of how to work with Sqlite, it made sense for me to leverage that expertise and apply it to this project. By choosing Sqlite, I was able to apply the skills and understanding I gained from studying the database module at university

                            SQLAlchemy: I chose to utilize SQLAlchemy as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library for this project. SQLAlchemy provides a powerful and flexible way to interact with databases using Python. It simplifies the process of building and executing database queries, allowing for easier and more efficient development. By leveraging SQLAlchemy, I was able to take advantage of its rich set of features and functionality, making the development process smoother and more straightforward.

                        <li>
                            Flask-Migrate: I used Flask-Migrate to make managing database changes easier. It allowed me to update the database structure without writing complex SQL queries directly. Instead, I could define the changes using simple Python code. Flask-Migrate then handled generating the necessary SQL statements for me. It also provided a convenient way to run seed scripts, which helped me populate the database with initial data effortlessly. Thanks to Flask-Migrate, I could efficiently manage and update the database for the website without getting tangled up in intricate database queries.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Flask-Login: I utilized Flask-Login to simplify the authentication process in my application. It provided an easy-to-use interface for handling user login and session management. With Flask-Login, I could securely handle user authentication, login sessions, and access control with minimal code. It abstracted away the complexities of session management and provided useful features like remembering users across sessions and protecting routes that required authentication. Flask-Login made it straightforward to implement authentication functionality in my application, saving me time and effort.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Flask-WTF: I used Flask-WTF to simplify form management in my application. It provided convenient features for handling forms, including validation and protection against CSRF attacks. With Flask-WTF, I could easily define form fields, specify validation rules, and ensure the security of form submissions. It made form handling straightforward and enhanced the overall user experience.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Pillow: I used this library to get the size and width of the uploaded image to validate
